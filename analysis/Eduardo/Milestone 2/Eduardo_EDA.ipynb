However, upon looking into the data, the difference in the number of games that exist between **Action** and **Sports** is almost 700 games. This leads us to wonder if these three categories only sold so many games due to the sheer amount of games that are in these categories.  \\\n",

    "Upon further investigation, since this game also appears to originally have been sold in 2004 and was rated *M*, we went on to see what was unique about this seperate release. It just so happens that the developers had removed some more explicit features from the original base game which released in 2004, but that gamers had found a way to access this *\"removed\"* content which was hidden, yet left in the game's source code... \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this \"new\" version of the game which was now burned onto disks and circulated as being the 2005 version, the ERSB considered this a seperate game and gave it the *Adult Only* rating, which for most games hoping to make it internationally or sell very well, is a death sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception then of the *AO* rating, we see the majority of the game rated sell at roughly 550 thousand units to a million units on average. *E* and *M* rated games sell for roughly a million units on average, with *T* and *E10+* selling roughly 550 thousand units on average.\n",

    "From this, we can conclude that quite clearly the best genre of games are *M* Mature games which tend to have some graphic content or violence, which is  targeted to audiences of ages 17+, and *E* Everyone games, which includes sports, family, etc. kinds of games which are suitable for everyone. Both of these game ratings appeal to the greatest and most general audience, which makes sense that they should be topping the **Global_Sales** list. "

There is some difference in the year of release, as this dataset says it is 1985, though other entries say 1986. Regardless, this is interesting because the ESRB did not exist in 1985 or 86'.

Since the game was a direct port to the PC, the rating for the PC version applied to the original 1985 version.

This confirms that the original games rated by the ESRB was in the year it was created in, in 1994. Then in 1996, we see plenty of games having the ESRB ratings, which is good and expected."
